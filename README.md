# com.toya.sapui5task.myui5project

## Description

This app demonstrates a setup for developing UI5 applications.

## Requirements

Either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.

## Preparation

Use `npm` (or `yarn`) to install the dependencies in root folder, then navigate to the `myui5app` folder and install the dependencies again:

```sh
npm install
cd myui5app
npm install
```

(To use yarn, just do `yarn` instead.)

## Run the App

In the `myui5app` folder, execute the following command to run the app locally:

```sh
npm start
```

As shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.

(When using yarn, do `yarn start` instead.)
